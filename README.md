# htmlSpecScraper
Tool to get a all the attributes for each html5 tag

This project consists of 3 parts:
1. tags.py and htmlSpecScraper.py work together to produce a json representation of all the tags and their attributes.
2. boolean_attrs.py, empty_tags.py, event_attrs.py and global_attrs.py are not used in the project but are handy for code generators.
3. elements.json contains the output generated by #1, but manually edited to include h1-h6, and to fix the "phrase tag" elements to not
   have their list of other phrase tag elements in their attribute list. It is also pretty printed.

most of the source for all of this is https://www.w3schools.com
