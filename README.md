# htmlSpecScraper
Tool to get a all the attributes for each html5 tag

Really you probably just want elements.json. The rest of the project is just to generate that file.

Code is MIT licensed. I am making elements.json available under the MIT license, and releasing also it to the public domain wherever
that makes sense legally. You can do whatever you want with that file. ALL WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I manually added the h1-h6 to the json because they are all mushed together on the web page.

I manually removed the list of other phrase tags from the phrase tag elements because they look like attributes to the scraper.

I manually copied the output string from the command line and pasted into a web pretty printer to get the final json file.
